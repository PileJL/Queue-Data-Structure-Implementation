Araw man o gabi
Diwata oh
Kay gandang diwata oh
Check my phone young boy got a text
12 AM all alone what's next
Found my keys and I hit the gas
In an hour I'll be up for the task
Like a blast from the past
I ain't confused but girl I'm attached
This not good my heart beating fast

Will this thing we have really last, I don't know 
yet I've been craving for you
'Cause this feels so true
If there's heaven on earth, baby girl 
I'll fill it with you
I really wanna beg you boo
Wine is best enjoyed with a glass for two
Please, tell me baby do you feel it too
Is it mutual or we just comfortable

Oh diwatang kay ganda
Mahiwagang mahika
Sakin hulog ng langit

Oh diwatang kay ganda
Mahiwagang mahika
Sakin nagpapaibig
