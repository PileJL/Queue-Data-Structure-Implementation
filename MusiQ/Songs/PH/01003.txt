Every color and every hue
Is represented by me and you
Take a slide in the slope
Take a look in the kaleidoscope
Spinnin' round, make it twirl
In this kaleidoscope world

Yeah



Some are great and some are few
Others lie, while some tell the truth
And some say poems and some do sing
Another sing through their guitar strings
Some know it all, while some act dumb
Let the bass line strum to the bang of the drum
Some can swim, while some will sink
And some will find their minds and think
Others walk, while others run
